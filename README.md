# homepage-tailwind
A simple responsive homepage of a website structured using HTML and styled using tailwind CSS utility classes.
I created this layout after completing 21 days course titled "Conquering Responsive Layouts" by Kevin Powell. This was the final challange given by the instructor at the end of the course. Although, I was supposed to use vanilla CSS but I used tailwind CSS because I am comfortable in it.
